# Downloading and preparing the input data from other studies to merge with the Mexican wolf genotypes

## Download LUPA dataset
The LUPA datasets can be found here ([LUPA data](http://dogs.genouest.org/SWEEP.dir/Supplemental.html)) and are associated with the publication by [Vaysse et al. 2011 PLoS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002316).  This publication also describes the development of the [CanineHD beadchip](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/microarray-kits/caninehd.html) from Illumina.  The complete LUPA dataset contains 547 individuals (15 gray wolves + 532 domestic dogs from 48 breeds) and 174810 loci.
```bash
# Download LUPA genotype data
curl -O http://dogs.genouest.org/SWEEP.dir/HDselection_updated_trees.ped
curl -O http://dogs.genouest.org/SWEEP.dir/HDselection_updated_trees.map
mv HDselection_updated_trees.ped LUPA.ped
mv HDselection_updated_trees.map LUPA.map
```

The SNP IDs are formatted using the GenBank or other database assession codes.  For example, "BICF2P18660", or "TIGRP2P2672".  For ease of use and comparison across studies, convert to the format "chromosome\_position" (e.g., chr1\_12345678).

```bash
# Convert SNP ID format
cat LUPA.map | \
   perl -ne 'chomp; @a=split(/\t/,$_); print "$a[0] chr$a[0]_$a[3] 0 $a[3]\n"' | \
   tr " " "\t" > tmp
mv tmp LUPA.map
```

At this point, there are 13 SNPs that belong to chromosome 40 (Y) at the end of the file.  I manually went in with VIM or any text editor and changed the SNP name and position to "40 chr40\_1 0 1", "40 chr40\_2 0 2"... "40 chr40\_13 0 13".
Now make a list of these X and Y SNPs to be excluded later in downstream analyses.

```bash
# Make a list of XY SNPs to exclude
grep "^39" LUPA.map | \
   cut -f2 | \
   cat - <(grep "^40" LUPA.map | cut -f2) > exclude.list
```
The file `exclude.list` should contain 5744 X and Y SNP IDs.

The LUPA dataset is now ready for downstream processing

## Download and Prepare Stronen genotypes
The Stronen dataset is from [Stronen et al. 2015 Ecology & Evolution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4667828/).  The dataset contains "59 unrelated wolves from four previously identified population clusters (northcentral Europe n = 32, Carpathian Mountains n = 7, Dinaric‚ÄêBalkan n = 9, Ukrainian Steppe n = 11).".  The genotype data were made available in Dryad [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p6598). Unfortunately, only genotypes from SNPs after quality filtering were made available (137978 SNP loci)

   tr " " "\t" > tmp
mv tmp Stronen.map

# NOW DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE Y CHROMOSOME FORMATS IN VIM AS MENTIONED ABOVE!!!!
   # Ony 1 Y chromsome SNP in the dataset
```
The Stronen dataset is now ready for downstream processing
