# Mexican_Wolf_SNPs
The repository contains code for the analysis of the Mexican wolf SNP data.  Please follow the links below to get the code and associated descriptions for various analyses and data processing.

1. Analyzing the initial Mexican wolf genotypes
  - processing the MW genotypes alone, including data cleaning, LD pruning, PCA, admixture, etc
2. [Merging together the Mexican wolf genotypes with 4 other canine genotyping studies](./data-prep.md)
  - xxxxx
3.  [Identifying local admixture in MW with domestic dogs](./xxx)
  - using BEAGLE to phase and then LAMPLD to find local haplotype assignment to parental populations
4.  [Simulating admxture](./xxx)
  - A series of simulations to evaluate expected local haplotype structure under various migration schemes between Mexican wolves and domestic dogs.
