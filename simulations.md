# Simulating Canine Evolutionary History
This set of code contains the scripts for simulating the demographic history of Mexican wolves, North American gray wolves, European gray wolves, and domestic dogs.  The demographic model used is that from [Fan et al. (2016, doi:10.1101/gr.197517.115)](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/2/163).

Below is Figure 6 from Fan et al. (2016):

Caption: Demographic model inferred using G-PhoCS. Estimates of divergence times and effective population sizes (Ne) inferred by applying a Bayesian demography inference method (G-PhoCS) to sequence data from 13,647 putative neutral loci in a subset of 22 canid genomes (because of limitations in computational power). Estimates were obtained in four separate analyses (Methods; Supplemental Table 6). Ranges of Ne are shown and correspond to 95% Bayesian credible intervals. Estimates are calibrated by assuming a per-generation mutation rate of μ = 10−8. Mean estimates (vertical lines) and ranges corresponding to 95% Bayesian credible intervals are provided at select nodes. Scales are given in units of years by assuming an average generation time of 3 yr and two different mutation rates: μ = 10−8 (dark blue) and μ = 4 × 10−9 (brown). The model also considered gene flow between different population groups (see Table 1).
